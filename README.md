 # Additionnal Material
 I have included it in the material but [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)is a nice    Markdown "cheat sheet" for looking up how to make tables, code-blocks, etc., in Markdown.

       ``git checkout -b your_branch_name``;
   
   3. Check out your new branch and commit any changes you make to it;
      
   4. Push your branch: ``git push origin your_branch_name`` (you should have permission to do this, if you are added as a "contributor" to this project);
      
   5. Create a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) from your branch into the master branch.
